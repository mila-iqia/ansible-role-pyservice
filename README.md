# ansible-pyservice

Role for Python applications/services.


## Prerequisites

In order to be compatible with this role, a project must follow these rules:

* It must be available as a Git repository that is visible from the host.
* The repository directory must be pip-installable using `pip -e REPO_PATH`.
* At the top level, there must be a file named `pinned-requirements.txt` installable with `pip -r` which contains versions for all dependencies.
  * You may generate this file from a `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py` or `requirements.txt` file with the `pip-compile` utility in the `pip-tools` package. Do not forget to commit it and update it whenever there are changes.


## Overview of the installation

By default, the pyservice role will create a user, and the following hierarchy:

```bash
# Root for all pyservice-installed applications, owner is root
/applications        # Variable: {{ global_app_root }}
  # Conda environments are hosted here
  /miniconda3        # Variable: {{ conda_base }}
  # App directory; owner is the the app user
  /APP_NAME          # Variable: {{ app_root }}
    # Application code and configuration
    /app             # Variable: {{ app_dir }}
      # The repository is cloned here
      /code          # Variable: {{ app_code_dir }}
      # Configuration files, certificates, keys, etc.
      /config        # Variable: {{ app_config_dir }}
        # Default configuration file, provided for convenience but not mandatory
        config.yaml  # Variable: {{ app_config }}
    # Application data (anything that must be backed up)
    /data            # Variable: {{ app_code_dir }}
/etc
  /systemd
    /system
      # Service files defined in {{ app_services }}
      APP_NAME-xyz.service
      ...
      # Timer files for recurrent work, defined in {{ app_timers }}
      APP_NAME-uvw.service
      APP_NAME-uvw.timer
      ...
```

Installation proceeds as follows:

1. `setup` tasks
  1. Deactivate all services related to the app and delete their files
  2. Clone the repository
  3. Install Conda in `conda_base` if not installed
  4. Create a Conda environment for the application
  5. Install the dependencies defined in the repo's `pinned-requirements.txt`
  6. Optionally write files as defined in `app_files`
2. (Do custom setup here)
3. `activate` tasks
  1. Write the service files and activate them

The application's work must be defined in two lists:

* `app_services` for services that must be up at all times, such as a web server or an API
* `app_timers` for recurrent work, such as scraping information or generating a report every day or week


## Important variables

The following variables can/must be set in the inventory:

* `app_name`: The name of the application.
* `app_module`: The name of the Python module defined by the application. Defaults to `{{ app_name }}`.
* `app_user`: The user under which the app should be run and which owns the configuration and data.
  * Set `app_ensure_user` to `false` in order not to do this, if you want to control user creation.
* `app_group`: The group to create the various directories under. Defaults to `{{ ansible_common_remote_group | default(app_user) }}`.
* `app_repo`: Path to the application repository.
  * If the repo is private, you should set `app_ssh_key` to a private key that is authorized to read the repo (use the SSH URL for the repo), or set `app_ssh_key_path` to the path to the proper file on the host.
* `app_tag`: Tag or branch of the `app_repo` to checkout.
* `python_version`: Python version to use.
* `conda_version`: Conda version to use. See the list [here](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda). Put the part of the name that's in between `Miniconda3` and `.sh`, e.g. `latest-Linux-aarch64` or `py311_23.10.0-1-Linux-x86_64`. Make sure it's the right architecture.


## Defining a service

The `app_services` variable should contain a list of services. Each service has a name, description and associated command:

```yaml
app_services:
  - name: web
    description: "Run the web interface for {{ app_name }}"
    command: python -m {{ app_module }} --config {{ app_config }} web
```

The command is run in the conda environment created by the role, and it can be anything you want.


## Defining a timer

The `app_timers` variable should contain a list of timers. Each timer has a name, description, schedule and associated command:

```yaml
app_timers:
  - name: something
    description: "Do something every Monday at 2 AM"
    schedule: "Mon, 02:00"
    command: python -m {{ app_module }} --config {{ app_config }} do_something
```

The syntax for the schedule is described [here in section 4.2](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd/Timers). It ends up in an `OnCalendar` declaration, so you can look at the examples for that.

The command is run in the conda environment created by the role, and it can be anything you want.


## Writing file content

You can easily write files based on content that is in various variables:

```yaml
app_files:
  - dest: "{{ app_config_dir }}/certificate"
    content: "{{ certificate_contents }}"
    mode: "0600"  # default mode is also 0600
```


## Other variables

* `global_app_root`: The path where all applications will be installed into subdirectories (defaults to `/applications`)
* `app_root`: The path on the target system in which to put all the code, configuration and data. Defaults to `{{ global_app_root }}/{{ app_name }}`
* `app_code_dir`: Path to the cloned repository.
* `app_data_dir`: The path on the target system in which to put application data. Defaults to `{{ app_root }}/data`
* `app_dir`: The path on the target system in which to put all the code and configuration. Defaults to `{{ app_root }}/app`
* `app_config_dir`: The path on the target system in which to put configuration. Defaults to `{{ app_dir }}/config`.
* `app_config`: Path to the configuration file (defaults to `{{ app_config_dir }}/config.yaml`)
* `conda_base`: The path where to find or install miniconda (defaults to `{{ global_app_root }}/miniconda3`)
* `conda_isolate`: If true, miniconda will be put under `app_dir` (defaults to false). It's pointless to change this if you change `conda_base`.
* `conda_run`: Put that in front of a shell command to run it in the app's conda environment.


## Example playbook

The typical playbook should run the `setup` tasks, then some custom operations, typically templating a configuration file, then run the `activate` tasks. The `app_services`, `app_timers` and `app_files` variables can be defined in the playbook since it makes little sense to change them in the inventory, except possibly for the timer schedules.

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  vars:
    app_services:
      - name: web
        description: "Run the web interface for {{ app_name }}"
        command: python -m {{ app_module }} --config {{ app_config }} web
    app_timers:
      - name: something
        description: "Do something every Monday at 2 AM"
        schedule: "Mon, 02:00"
        command: python -m {{ app_module }} --config {{ app_config }} do_something
    app_files:
      - dest: "{{ app_config_dir }}/certificate"
        content: "{{ certificate_contents }}"
        mode: "0600"

  tasks:
  - name: Install
    import_role:
      name: pyservice
      tasks_from: setup

  - name: Template configuration
    ansible.builtin.template:
      src: "config.yaml"
      dest: "{{ app_config }}"
      owner: "{{ app_user }}"
      mode: "0600"

  - name: Activate
    import_role:
      name: pyservice
      tasks_from: activate
```
